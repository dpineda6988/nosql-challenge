A jupyter notebook analysis that creates and analyzes a MongoDB database covering several food establishments within the UK market

## Description

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. I've been contracted by the editors of a hypothetical food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.


### Dependencies
* MongoDB
* jupyter notebook - file names: 'NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb' and NoSQL_seteup_starter.ipynb 
* Python with libraries pandas and pprint
* file establishments.json stored in Resources folder

### Execution
 NoSQL_seteup_starter.ipynb should be run first to establish the database.  'NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb' will then execute the analysis
